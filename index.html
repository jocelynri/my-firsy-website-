  it is a good day to <b>create my first website!!!</b>
  
  <p> 
   This is my first time doing a wedsite ,what image of how people publishing a whole article in the 
   internet its now tottaly gone now that i know they have to go through all of this,to put a title
  , paragraghts and subtilees ,label each section whit "tags".I found this really complicated , to
   know what tag you need to use for a spesific section , if your website dosent look "correct" you 
   need to go back and chek evrything ,ugh,to much work.I used to take a class that teached softwear
   stuff and used different tags to make objects move ,made colors changed outomatecly .
