  <h1>My First Website</h1>
  <h2>An HTML Playground (if you know how to use it ) </h2>
  
  it is a good day to <b>create my first website!!!</b>
  <h2>what i thought about websites</h2>
  <p> 
   This is my first time doing a website ,the image of how people publishing a whole article in the 
   internet its now tottaly gone now that i know they have to go through all of this,to put a title
  , paragraghts and subtilees ,label each section whit "tags".I found this really complicated , to
   know what tag you need to use for a spesific section , if your website dosent look "correct" you 
   need to go back and chek evrything ,ugh,to much work.I used to take a class that teached softwear
   stuff and used different tags to make objects move ,made colors changed outomatecly .
  </p>
  <h2>advanteges and disanvanteges</h2>
  <P>
   Over all i'am exited to start creating websites,they are one way to communicate /reach people 
   around the world ,to let others know of news (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccines>"
   target="blank">for example</a>),warnings,it can even tell us what event are happening in our world .There are negetive
   outcomes from creating websites too like spreading false information,talk trash of someone ,spread 
   rumors or even laugh at sensetive content meaning websites can be used for
   many reasons.
